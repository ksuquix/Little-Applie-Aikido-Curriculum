Footwork:

Suri-ashi (Sliding Feet): The foundation of all kendo, where feet slide across the floor without lifting to maintain constant contact, reducing friction and enabling fast movement.

Slide: Okuri-ashi (Trailing Foot): The standard, most used movement. Move the right foot forward (or backward), then quickly bring the left foot up to match, maintaining the initial distance between feet.

Tsugi-ashi (Subsequent Foot): A, step used to close distance. The left foot moves up to touch or pass the right foot before the right foot moves again to strike.

Hiraki-ashi (Diagonal/Open Foot): A movement to evade or create angles, where you move diagonally to the right or left, often with a slight pivot.

Step: Ayumi-ashi (Walking Feet): A natural walking movement used for traversing longer distances quickly, rarely used in close combat.
