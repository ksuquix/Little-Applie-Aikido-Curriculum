# Weapons Study list and Testing Requirements (In addition to USAF)

- Most of the weapons curriculum is based on Iwama-style foundations.
- Sword mechanics are highly influenced by Seishinkan Iaido standards.

## Active study:

- Jo Suburi (20) - Saito  
- Jo Awase (8) - Saito via Kobayashi 
- 31 Jo Kata - Saito 
- Ken Suburi (7) - Saito  
- Happo Giri - Saito
- Ken Awase (7) - Saito
- Shin Ken Awase (?) - USAF via Vu
    - Ken Partner Blocking exercise - USAF via Hayes
    - Ken Connection - USAF via Hayes
    - I've only seen most of this content from Vu at seminars.  I believe the exercises were Hayes Sensei breaking the larger piece down for us.  I plan on doing similar and making several smaller Awase from Vu's seminar video.
