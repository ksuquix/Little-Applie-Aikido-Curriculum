# Ken Awase (Saito / Kobayashi)

Uchitachi (打太刀) is the senior "teaching" role in Kendo Kata. The uchitachi initiates all movements, controls the distance (maai), and sets the timing for the student, or shitachi/uketachi (仕太刀). 

1. Uchitachi prepares tsugi-ashi tsuki.  Shitachi responds with hiraki-ashi to the Uchitachi's inside, and shomenuchi to Uchitachi's wrist.
2. Uchitachi prepares tsugi-ashi Tsuki, pushing shitachi's sword offline.  Shitachi steps tenshin, raising sword.  Uchitachi returns to original chudan-no-kamae.  Shitachi steps around and does large yokomen to wrist.
3. Start as (1). Shitachi lets Uchitachi raise sword (or uchitachi responds quickly) stepping back, but matches movement sliding in with Tsuki to neck.
4.  Both raise, meet in cut together.   Uchitachi pushes Shitachi's sword, but shitachi slips around and does Tsuki while hiraki-ashi to outside.
5. Uchitachi prepares tsugi-ashi shomenuchi.  Shitachi does fadeaway block, steps around in yokomen to outside wrist.  Uchitachi raises, stepping back.  Shitachi enters, cutting wrist from below.

Footwork:

Suri-ashi (Sliding Feet): The foundation of all kendo, where feet slide across the floor without lifting to maintain constant contact, reducing friction and enabling fast movement.

Slide: Okuri-ashi (Trailing Foot): The standard, most used movement. Move the right foot forward (or backward), then quickly bring the left foot up to match, maintaining the initial distance between feet.

Tsugi-ashi (Subsequent Foot): A, step used to close distance. The left foot moves up to touch or pass the right foot before the right foot moves again to strike.

Hiraki-ashi (Diagonal/Open Foot): A movement to evade or create angles, where you move diagonally to the right or left, often with a slight pivot.

Step: Ayumi-ashi (Walking Feet): A natural walking movement used for traversing longer distances quickly, rarely used in close combat.
